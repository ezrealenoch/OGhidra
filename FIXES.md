# Fixes for OGhidra-ADK Connectivity Issues

## Issues Identified

After reviewing the code and error logs, the following issues were identified:

1. **Ollama Connectivity Issue**: The application was unable to connect to the Ollama server, which was not running or not accessible at the default URL (`http://localhost:11434`).

2. **LiteLLM Model Initialization**: The code did not properly handle failed initialization of the LLM instance, causing errors when the agent tried to use it.

3. **Pydantic Model Error**: The `PlannerAgent` class had fields that overrode base class fields without the correct type annotations, causing Pydantic validation errors.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved Ollama Connectivity

- Added more robust error handling in `src/adk_agents/ghidra_analyzer/agents.py` to detect when the Ollama server is not available.
- Implemented proper model name formatting with consistent provider prefixes.
- Added clear environment variable handling for Ollama API base URL.

### 2. Enhanced LiteLLM Model Initialization

- Added a try-except block around LiteLLM initialization to gracefully handle connection failures.
- Implemented a fallback mechanism to try alternative models when the primary model is unavailable.
- Added logging to provide more detailed information about model initialization problems.

### 3. Fixed Pydantic Model Issues

- Added proper type annotations to the `PlannerAgent` class fields:
  - `name: str = "Planner"`
  - `instruction: str = "..."`
  - `model: Optional[LiteLlm] = None`

### 4. Added Diagnostic Tools

- Created a `health_check.py` script to verify connectivity to both Ollama and GhidraMCP services.
- Created a `verify_connection.py` script to test direct LiteLLM integration with Ollama.
- Added detailed logging to diagnose connectivity issues.

## Testing

All fixes were verified using the following tests:

1. **Health Check**: Both Ollama and GhidraMCP services were successfully contacted.
2. **LiteLLM Connection**: Successfully established a connection to the Ollama model via LiteLLM.
3. **GhidraMCP Integration**: Verified the ability to get function listings and other data from GhidraMCP.

## Usage

To ensure proper operation of the OGhidra-ADK application:

1. Ensure Ollama is running by executing `ollama serve` if it's not already running as a service.
2. Make sure the model specified in the configuration (default: `cogito:32b`) is available. If not, pull it with `ollama pull cogito:32b`.
3. Ensure the GhidraMCP server is running within Ghidra and accessible at the configured URL (default: `http://localhost:8080`).
4. Run the web interface with `adk web` and access it at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Run `python health_check.py` to verify service connectivity.
2. Run `python verify_connection.py` to test the LiteLLM integration.
3. Check the logs in `adk_web.log` for detailed error messages.
4. Ensure the Ollama server is running and the specified model is available.
5. Verify the GhidraMCP plugin is running in Ghidra with the correct configuration.
