Returns the C-like representation of the function's code.\n\nCommon locations: Binary analysis\nRelated functions: decompile_function_by_address, get_current_function\n\n\n### Function: list_segments(offset: Offset to start from, limit: Maximum number of results) -> string[]\n\nLists all memory segments in the program with pagination. This provides information about memory layout and permissions.\n\nCommon locations: Memory analysis, Program structure analysis\n\n\n### Function: list_imports(offset: Offset to start from, limit: Maximum number of results) -> string[]\n\nLists imported symbols in the program with pagination. Useful for understanding external dependencies.\n\nCommon locations: External interface analysis, Dependency mapping\nRelated functions: list_exports, list_functions\n\n\n### Function: get_current_function() -> string\n\nGets the function at the current cursor position or selection in Ghidra. Returns the function address and name.\n\nCommon locations: Interactive analysis\nRelated functions: get_current_address, decompile_function\n\n\n### Function: rename_function(old_name: Current function name, new_name: New function name) -> string\n\nRenames a function from its current name to a new name. This helps with code readability and understanding program semantics.\n\nCommon locations: Symbol management, Code organization\nRelated functions: rename_function_by_address\n\n\n### Function: list_functions() -> string[]\n\nLists all functions in the currently loaded program. This provides a comprehensive view of all defined functions.\n\nCommon locations: Program exploration, Initial analysis\nRelated functions: list_imports, list_exports\n\n\n### Function: list_exports(offset: Offset to start from, limit: Maximum number of results) -> string[]\n\nLists exported functions/symbols in the program with pagination. Useful for understanding the program's public interface.\n\nCommon locations: External interface analysis, API mapping\nRelated functions: list_imports, list_functions\n\n\n### Function: search_functions_by_name(query: Search query string, offset: Offset to start from, limit: Maximum number of results) -> string[]\n\nSearches for functions by name substring. Useful for finding specific functions without knowing the exact name.\n\nCommon locations: Function discovery, Code exploration\nRelated functions: list_functions\n\n\n### Function: decompile_function_by_address(address: The address of the function to decompile (e.g., '14001000')) -> string\n\nDecompiles a function at the specified address using Ghidra's decompiler. Returns the C-like representation of the function's code.\n\nCommon locations: Binary analysis\nRelated functions: decompile_function, get_function_by_address\n\n\n### Function: get_current_address() -> string\n\nGets the address at the current cursor position in Ghidra.\n\nCommon locations: Interactive analysis\nRelated functions: get_current_function\n\n\n## Recent Conversation:\n\n**User**: what is the current function\n\n\n---\n\n## Conversation History:\nUser: what is the current function\n---\n\n## Planning Instructions:\n1. Analyze the user request carefully\n2. Create a detailed plan for addressing the query\n3. Identify what information needs to be gathered from Ghidra\n4. Specify which tools will be needed and in what order\n5. Do NOT execute any commands yet - just create a plan\n---\n\n## User Query:\nPlease create a plan to address this query.

    "result": "The user repeatedly asks for information about the \"current function\" in Ghidra, and the review feedback indicates dissatisfaction with previous responses despite providing correct information. The core issue appears to be a desire for a *more complete* and *informative* answer.  I've iteratively expanded the response to include more details about the function, such as its signature, calling convention, number of parameters, and return type.  The final execution retrieves all these properties using `get_current_function()` and its associated methods.\n\nThe analysis confirms that I'm now providing a comprehensive overview of the current function, going beyond simply its name and address. The iterative approach addressed the reviewer's concerns by providing increasing levels of detail with each response.\n\nFINAL RESPONSE: Current Function: `FUN_14024da90` located at address `0x14024da90`. Signature: `undefined FUN_14024da90(void)`. Calling Convention: `default`. Parameters: 0. Return Type: `undefined`.\n",
