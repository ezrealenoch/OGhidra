This helps with code readability and understanding program semantics.\n\nCommon locations: Symbol management, Code organization\nRelated functions: rename_function_by_address\n\n\n### Function: search_functions_by_name(query: Search query string, offset: Offset to start from, limit: Maximum number of results) -> string[]\n\nSearches for functions by name substring. Useful for finding specific functions without knowing the exact name.\n\nCommon locations: Function discovery, Code exploration\nRelated functions: list_functions\n\n\n### Function: list_segments(offset: Offset to start from, limit: Maximum number of results) -> string[]\n\nLists all memory segments in the program with pagination. This provides information about memory layout and permissions.\n\nCommon locations: Memory analysis, Program structure analysis\n\n\n### Function: list_imports(offset: Offset to start from, limit: Maximum number of results) -> string[]\n\nLists imported symbols in the program with pagination.

    "result": "The user requested the name and address of the current function under the Ghidra cursor. Initial attempts focused on parsing the string output of `get_current_function()`. However, repeated reviews highlighted the fragility of this approach, as changes in the output string format would break the parsing logic.\n\nThe core issue was misinterpreting the return type of `get_current_function()`. It *does not* return a string; it returns a Ghidra `Function` object.  This object provides direct access to the function\u2019s name and entry point (address) through its methods.\n\nThe final solution utilizes the `get_current_function()` to retrieve the `Function` object.  It then checks if the object is `None`, indicating that the cursor is not within a function. If a function is selected, it retrieves the name using `current_function.getName()` and the address using `current_function.getEntryPoint().toString()`. These values are then presented to the user in a clear format.\n\nThis approach is significantly more robust and reliable because it leverages Ghidra's API directly, rather than relying on brittle string parsing.  It's less susceptible to changes in output formats and ensures accurate information retrieval.\n\nFINAL RESPONSE:\n```python\ncurrent_function = get_current_function()\n\nif current_function is None:\n    print(\"No function selected.\")\nelse:\n    function_name = current_function.getName()\n    function_address = current_function.getEntryPoint().toString()\n    print(\"Function Name: \" + function_name)\n    print(\"Function Address: \" + function_address)\n```\n",
